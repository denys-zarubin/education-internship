chool, smelly form
Fights, glue, so I became stronger
Stealing money in the locker room
At eight began smoking
At eleven I threw the first stick
Scored on parents
I began to disappear with friends in the dump
Kirzachi and the Cedar
Brezhnev died, began to go into the rocking chair
I bought boxing gloves
